To start the project:

- npm install
- npm start
- Open http://localhost:3000/


Usage:
- On headers, we have down-arrow and up-arrow. This will do the sorting accordingly.
- Added filters. We have to type case sensitive data to check for filters.
- Testes on mobile, tablet and desktop.

Tech:
- Used Create React app.
- Used React router DOM.
- Added mock data and did not use any server.
- The idea is to save all filetrs and sort values in the query params and extract state accordingly.
